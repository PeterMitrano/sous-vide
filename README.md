Mains power is scary. I used this to calculate trace width/clearance: http://www.desmith.net/NMdS/Electronics/TraceWidth.html

## Random Notes

ADC values for pot range from 417 to 938

### Revision Notes

 - hole size of screw terminals are too small. Should be 1.8542mm
 - label on V+ and V- on heater are backwards (J1)
 -  button pins are wrong
